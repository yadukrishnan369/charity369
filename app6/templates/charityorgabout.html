    <h1>Donate For Better World</h1>

    <br>


    <p> A charitable organization is a nonprofit organization that seeks to advance some public benefit.
    </p>


    <p>Charitable organizations survive primarily on donations. ... There are five main ways that charities stretch their dollars: by using volunteers, by hosting gala fundraising events, by selling products, by sponsoring events, and by advertising to bring
        in more donations.
    </p>

    <p>Churches and church associations. Organizations that support universities and colleges. Hospitals and organizations that are dedicated to medical research. Governments or special governmental units that are involved in charitable causes.</p>

    <p>Sometimes they are called your 'objectives'; the words mean the same. A charity must have one or more of the purposes which have been defined in law. These include things like: relieving poverty, education, religion, protecting the environment, animal
        welfare, human rights and community development.</p>

    <p>It's probably a good idea to kick off by explaining the differences between charities, not-for-profit organisations and NGOs. Broadly speaking, charities aid, promote and raise money for the public good. ... An NGO (not to be mistaken with the National
        Gamekeepers Organisation) stands for 'non-governmental organisation'.</p>

    <p>Education Charities. These non-profit organizations help needy students from every age class and school. ... Health Charities. These charity groups aim to aid the sick and those with physical disabilities. ... Environment Charities. ... Animal Charities.
        ... Art and Culture Charities. ... International NGOs.</p>

    <p>Charity is essential and therefore meant to be done for public benefit, relief and to provide assistance to people at times of need in any part of the world, especially those who are the victims of war, natural disaster, catastrophe, hunger, disease,
        poverty, orphans by supplying them with food, shelter, medical aid, ...</p>
